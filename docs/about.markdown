Hi ðŸ‘‹.
I am Nicholas Montana. I am an italian cybersecurity student at the university of Rome [La sapienza](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina-strutturale/home). I have strong interests in various field such as mathematical logic, cybersecurity, music, philosophy and computer science (But i am only good at eating). 

There are two reasons this blog was born:
- I am extremely curious, so i am always learning something new.
- I forget most of the things i learn.
So i realized that i could organize the researches i do to have them in a single place for future consultations and i could publish them on the internet so that they are accessible to everyone who is researching the same topics i am curious about. 

Please consider that most of the things you will read on this blog are my own personal researches and might be not 100% accurate. Backup your researches with some other sources and feel free to contact me when you spot some errors (and you will, i am sure). So let's break the ice and let's start with an error. I will state that even this about page contains errors. Now that i wrote that for sure this about page [will contain at least one error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preface_paradox)!
Have a nice stay. ðŸ˜„
